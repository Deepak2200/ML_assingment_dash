    "### 2. What is the dimensionality curse ?\n",
    "Ans: The curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features. It refers to the fact that algorithms are harder to design in high dimensions and often have a running time exponential in the dimensions."

    "Ans: Well it Depends on dataset. If it is comprised of points that are perfectly aligned, PCA can reduce the dataset down to 1 dimension and preserve 95% of the variance."

    "Ans: If I perform PCA on a 1,000-dimensional dataset, setting the explained variance ratio to 95%. In this case roughly 950 dimensions are required to preserve 95% of the variance. So the answer is, it depends on the dataset, and it could be any number between 1 and 950."

    "### 8. Is it logical to use two different dimensionality reduction algorithms in a chain ?\n",
    "Ans: Indeed, it often make any sense to chain two different dimensionality reduction algorithms. A common example is using PCA to quickly get rid of a large number of useless dimensions, then applying another much slower dimensionality reduction algorithm, such as LLE."
